<h2>Philosophy of Science</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The success of physics over the last three hundred years is to be 
attributed to the application of ‘the scientific method’. If other 
disciplines are to emulate the success of physics then that is to 
be achieved by understanding and applying this method.</p>
