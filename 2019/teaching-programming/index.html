<section >
<p>Programming by poking: why MIT stopped teaching SICP</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"The SICP curriculum no longer prepared engineers for what engineering is like today.
Sussman said that in the 80s and 90s, engineers built complex systems by combining simple
and well-understood parts. The goal of SICP was to provide the abstraction language for
reasoning about such systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Today, this is no longer the case. Sussman pointed out that engineers now routinely write
code for complicated hardware that they don’t fully understand. The same is true at the
software level, since programming environments consist of gigantic libraries with enormous
functionality. According to Sussman, his students spend most of their time reading manuals
for these libraries to figure out how to stitch them together to get a job done. He said that
programming today is “More like science. You grab this piece of library and you poke at it.
You write programs that poke it and see what it does. And you say, ‘Can I tweak it to do the
thing I want?'”. The “analysis-by-synthesis” view of SICP — where you build a larger system
out of smaller, simple parts — became irrelevant. Nowadays, we do programming by poking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comment: "Programing by synthesis of well understood parts is graceful and beautiful and fun.
Programming by trying to get never-well-documented libraries to barely do something is f<em></em>*ing torture."</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section >
<p>The risks and benefits of teaching purely functional programming in first year
- Haskell
- "we should not teach purely functional programming" -
but we should teach essential programming concepts
- problems with I/O and "hello world"</p>
<p>AIMS
- convey elementery techniques of programming
- introduce essential computing concepts
- develop analytic thinking and problem solving</p>
<p>NOTES
- technical advantages of functional languages are obvious
- Haskell works as an equaliser between students who know some programming and those who don't
-&gt; female students coming from mathematics background
-&gt; also the case for SICP</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>Why calculating is better than scheming
- KRC (Kent Recursive Calculator) / Miranda
- SICP is too tightly linked to Scheme
- lacks: pattern matching, syntax close to mathematical notation, lazy evaluation, static types
- based on experience teaching both
- Miranda makes it easier to prove equations (syntactically)
- one exercise ("mobiles") and learning from that
-&gt; types help
-&gt; can define abstract data type
- confusion about 'program is data' (vs. revelation that 'program is data')
- you can still treat programs as data:
-&gt; "simple interpreter" example - showing what kinds of examples we care about</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>The structure and interpretation of computer science curriculum<br />
- SICP focused on CS concepts like abstraction
- 2000 critique of SICP by Jackson &amp; Chapin
"our experience suggests that undergraduate computer science courses should emphasize
basic notions of modularity, specification, and data abstraction, and should not let
these be displaced by more advanced topics, such as design patterns, object-oriented
methods, concurrency, functional languages, and so on"
- series of teaching languages based on Scheme with increasing language complexity</p>
<p>WANTS
- whatever is needed in upstream courses
- latest industry trends that they've read about in the news
- students have different things they want to learn/do - will disappoint some
- it's important to "explain our choice" well</p>
<p>"Clearly, a computer science curriculum must not, and doesn’t have to,
become a vocational training ground for the latest industrial programming
language and programming tools."</p>
<p>SCHEME
- don't have to spend time explaining types
- syntax is simple
- SICP relies on complex CS domain knowledge - interesting for MIT students</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>From Principles to Practice with Class in the First Year
- WANT TO teach industrial object-oriented language by the end of the first year
- transition from teaching language (scheme, etc.) to object-oriented "professional"
language through a series of small educational languages that add concepts
- first semester with HTDP, second semester with Java?</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>Teaching Java with the BlueJ environment
- BlueJ is educational Java environment that "allows students to concentrate on solving
programming problems without becoming distracted by the mechanics of compiling and
executing Java programs"
-&gt; Maybe that's what we should teach though :-)
- problem with translating concepts from simple educational environment to the real one
(K\"oling and Rosenberg, 1996)</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>Teaching Java First: Experiments with a Pigs - Early Pedagogy<br />
- object-oriented concepts first
- The Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula (2001) notes that Java and C++ are significantly
more complex than classical languages. Unless instructors take special care to introduce the
material in a way that limits this complexity, such details can easily overwhelm introductory
students.
- "Karel the Robot" approach - microworld
- uses BlueJ</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>On Teaching How to Design Programs
- HTPD includes things like "testing" and "refactoring"
- "Findler et al. (2002) argue that the type systems of  Haskell  and  ML  are  too  sophisticated
for  beginning  students,but that a first-order, monomorphic type system might be helpful for
beginning students. Felleisen et al. (2004a) argue that dynamic typing is a benefit because
students and teachers need not spend energy finding and explaining static type errors. (And when
a type error occurs dynamically, it comes with an example!)"</p>
