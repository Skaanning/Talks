> Good morning! This talk combines two lines of thinking - it takes some ideas from a more 
> theoretical programming language research that I've done in my PhD with and it combines them 
> with more applied work on programming tools for data science that I've been doing recently.

***************************************************************************************************

# Motivation
_Easy, trustworthy and accessible data science_

<br />

# Vision
_The essence of programming process_ 

> The more immediate applied part of the research is making it easier to use data - and I see making
> facts more accessible and trustworthy as a way in which a computer scientist can fight with 
> dangerous trends in the society today. 
>
> The way data scientists program is very interesting from the programming language perspective,
> because it breaks some of the usual assumptions about programming.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<img src="images/inequality.png" style="height:700px;margin-left:150px;margin-top:-20px" />

> The data science I have in mind is often quite simple and it is done for example by journalists.
> For example, this Guardian article is using data to illustrate inequality in the world. Do
> we trust the data? Yes, we do, because we are academics and we trust The Guardian!
>
> But what if we wanted to verify this? That is quite hard - The Guardian says the source is
> the WorldBank, but how do we check that? The problem is that there is no source code!

## _What makes spreadsheets successful?_

## _How can programming tools learn?_

<div class="fragment">

## Think of programming as interaction!

</div>

> The interesting question for a programming language person is - what makes spreadsheets so
> successful? And more importantly, how can programming tools learn from spreadsheets?

> My key point is that we need to think about the process of programming. In spreadsheets,
> you work with data directly, which is quite different from how most programming systems work.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> To illustrate, I'll show you how to get the inequality data from the WorldBank using
> an F# script. This is using Jupyter notebook, hosted on Microsoft which comes with the
> F# Data library that I created in Microsoft Research.
>
> I wrote a PLDI paper about the theory behind this, which won a best paper award, but 
> let's focus on the interactions - how I actually write the code.

## Programming for data science

_<span class="circ"><span>1</span></span> Data analytics is an interactive process_ 

_<span class="circ"><span>2</span></span> Program against data, not abstract symbols_

> As you can see in the demo, programming with data is a very interactive process.
> You write some code using autocomplete, run it, look at the results, then modify
> your code. This interactivity is super important. Also, you typically work with 
> real or sample data directly. Your variables actually have values that you could 
> use to help the programmer.
 
***************************************************************************************************

# Research vision
_Programming as human data interaction_

> My key research idea is that we need to focus on programming and see it as an interactive
> process of working with data - I'll focus on data, but the same applies to interactive
> theorem proving where you interact with your theorems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The essence of human data interaction
_Lambda calculus, but for programming interactions_

<br />

_<i class="fa fa-pencil-alt"></i> <em>Formal mathematical perspective</em>_

_<i class="fa fa-user"></i> <em>Human centric perspective</em>_

_<i class="fa fa-wrench"></i> <em>Enables new tools and methods</em>_

> To understand programming properly, we need to find some small tractable model of it.
> In functional programming, we use lambda calculus to understand what is going on, so we
> need a similar essence of programming interactions. Then we can analyze it formally, 
> use it to understand the human side of programming and use it as a basis for new
> tools and verification methods - and find new ways of working with data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Formal mathematical perspective

_<span class="circ"><span>1</span></span> Relative type safety_

_<span class="circ"><span>2</span></span> Provenance of interactions<span style="font-size:75%"><span class="ref"><span>ICFP 2014</span></span> <span class="ref"><span>ICALP 2013</span></span></span>_

_<span class="circ"><span>3</span></span> Properties of program construction_

> What can we say about interactions formally? There are standard ideas like type safety
> which gain a new meaning - because they might depend on data. We can also track provenance
> throughout the interaction. For example, if you make "copy and paste" a primitive, you can
> track provenance in ways that were previously impossible. I'm very interested in this, 
> because my PhD research on coeffects can help with this. Finally, there are also new properties
> that are related to how programs can be constructed interactively.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Human centric perspective

_<span class="circ"><span>1</span></span> Cognitive cost of interactions_

_<span class="circ"><span>2</span></span> Programming by direct manipulation_

> From the human centric perspective, we can look at cognitive cost of individual interactions.
> For example, selecting an option from an autocomplete - as you can do in F# Data - is easier
> than if you have to type a column name from scratch. Can we solve more complex problems
> with such simpler modes of interaction?
>
> Second, we can also find ways to do some of programming not by writing code, but by 
> manipulating with the data directly like in spreadsheets.

_<span class="circ"><span>2</span></span> The essence of interactions_

_<span class="circ"><span>3</span></span> Easy, trustworthy data science and more_
 
> To summarize, I think a lot of the foundational programming language work has been

> as an interactive process. The way to do this is to think about the essence - or a 
> minimal calculus - which then allows us to build new tools for easy trustworthy

> AI assistants. Finally, I talked about one of the things that I'm interested in, but I also
> work on philosophy and history of programming and I got invited to submit a paper to an

# _Build a_ language _for a given_ domain!

## Domain specific languages

_<span class="circ"><span>1</span></span>_ **External** – _New language with custom syntax_

_<span class="circ"><span>2</span></span>_ **Internal** – _Library in an existing language_

> There are two basic ways of doing this. You can create a new language - a good example

# _DSL =_ SYNTAX _+ MODEL_

> So, how do you build a domain specific language? There are two parts to this. First, 
> you need to think about the model - what does the language describe. Then, you need to
> think about a nice syntax that will make it readable. I'll start with the syntax.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Functional languages
_Custom operators and function composition_

    (Fun.cone |> Fun.color Color.red) $
    (Fun.cylinder |> Fun.move (0, -1, 0))

<div class="fragment" style="margin-top:50px">

### Object-oriented languages
_Fluent interfaces and the builder pattern_

    [lang=csharp]
    fun.cone().withColor(color.red).
      combineWith(fun.cylinder().moveBy(0, -1, 0))

</div>

> In functional languages, you can often define a nice syntax by having a couple of 
> operators and composing functions. Here, we have primitives like cone and cylinder,
> transformations using pipe and composition using dollar.
>
> In object oriented languages, you can achieve very similar thing using "fluent interfaces"
> and dot. If you read the code, it is fairly readable and you can explain this to 
> non-programmers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# _DSL = SYNTAX +_ MODEL

> The more important part of a domain specific language is the model. Here, you really
> need to think about what I want to describe in the language. This is the important part
> that you need to design carefully.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Object-oriented languages
_Modelling using class hierarchies_

<img class="fragment" src="images/hierarchy.png" style="width:600px;margin:60px 0px 0px 100px" />

> In object oriented languages, you can model the domain as a class hierarchy. Using our
> shapes example, we will have an abstract base class for a shape and a couple of concrete
> shapes. Here, cube and sphere are primitives and move with combine are composed and contain
> other shapes.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Functional languages
_Modelling using algebraic data types_

    type Shape = 
      | Cube 
      | Sphere
      | Move of Shape * float * float * float
      | Combine of Shape * Shape

> The object oriented model directly maps to a functional model. In functional languages, you
> will model the same thing using algebraic data types. Here, I say that a shape is either
> a primitive (cube or sphere) or a more complex case - move contains another shape and an 
> offset and combine combines two other shapes.

> This is why it is nice to know both object oriented and functional programming!
